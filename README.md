Visa’s Business Activities

In the year 1950’s Bank of America was known as the most well known bank of that time-period. Who was not only the biggest know bank but also willing to provided financial loans to common middle-class consumer. As the consumer segment began to grow, the bank launched the credit card. This concept derived from Diner Club which was the base of multiple users to use one system of card to pay for various transactions. By the means of a revolving credit where they could spend the amount of money desired as a form of loan from the bank.  Over time this view of loaning money backfired and became the cause of fraud in 1958 as customer who had the cards did not pay up on the late payments. Soon after the bank lost millions. Problems derived one after the other from authorization of valid cards to interchange of transactions between banks. To rectify the authorization in 1973 NBI (National BankAmericard Inc) digitalized the process for validation of the card through computer automated system.

Recommendations

Looking at the day and age of how the world is evolving in technology. Visa should adopt a new method of payment. Instead of having the conventional plastic card they should investigate an idea of facial recognition. People must carry their wallets and purse wherever they go instead if biometrics was introduced to the terminal, then the concept of a cards would be abolished. This would make the factor of authentication of the method of payment more accurate as the face will be the ultimate proof to any financial transaction. This can be linked to any governmental date base. The number one issues that comes up with banking is when large amount of wire transaction that take place. Extra precaution and proof of documentations are required before the sum of money can be transferred. By introducing facial recognition large amount or day to day expense will be more accurate. There will be none to less fraud as each face is different. Authentication process of a signature will be there as just back up to face. This will benefit the company when credit card disputes are there or any transactional glitches that may arise. They would have to imbed a new algorithm facial recognition to the terminal when one pays for a good or services. This could be how the government use it currently or many smartphone companies have introduced it in unlocking phones.  As mentioned, fraud is the number one issue that come up when one talks about credit card disputes. This will be a way to prevent that case as the proof will lie in the face of the person making the transaction. This will change the fact of authentication and authorization of the online digitalization of banking world and open banking.
